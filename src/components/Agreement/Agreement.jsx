  </p>
</div>
<div>
  You are responsible for any injury, damage, or loss caused to others. You agree to provide liability,
  collision, and comprehensive insurance that covers you, us, and the vehicle. If state law requires us to
  provide auto liability insurance, or if you do not have auto liability insurance, we will provide auto
  liability insurance (the “Policy”) that is secondary to any other valid and collectible insurance, whether
  primary, secondary, excess, or contingent. The Policy offers bodily injury and property damage liability
  coverage up to the minimum levels mandated by the vehicular financial responsibility laws of the state
  whose laws apply to the loss. You and we reject PIP, medical payments, no-fault, and uninsured or
  under-insured motorist coverage, where permitted by law. The Policy is void if you breach this agreement
  or fail to cooperate in a loss investigation conducted by us or our insurer. Allowing an unauthorized
  driver to operate the vehicle will also terminate coverage under the Policy.
</div>
<div>
  <h4>Payment Section</h4>
  <p>
    The credit card provided will be used to charge you for the rental, damage deposit ($275.53), and
    any damage charges incurred. Please inspect the cart and report any existing damages before use.
    If a renter receives a parking ticket and does not pay it, a $250 fee will be charged in addition
    to the ticket amount by South Walton Carts LLC. A valid credit card must be on file to rent a cart
    and available at the time of rental. Failure to provide a valid card at the time of rental may delay
    or cancel the rental drop-off. By signing this contract, you authorize South Walton Carts LLC to charge
    the credit card used to book the rental through the rental software.

  </p>

  <h4>
    Cancellation Policy
  </h4>
  <p>
    Cancellations made at least 48 hours prior to the delivery date will not incur a cancellation fee, but a $100 paperwork fee will apply. Cancellations made less than 48 hours in advance will incur an additional $125 cancellation fee on top of the paperwork fee. South Walton Carts reserves the right to hold a $250 damage deposit on the provided credit card.

    Carts LLC must be notified immediately, and a traffic report must be obtained. Any injury to the
    renter(s) or other parties must also be reported to South Walton Carts LLC as soon as possible.

    either of these, please be aware that we will charge your card for all associated damages, labor
    costs, and any missed rental payments.

  <h4>
    CHECK IN (Please print for your trip)
  </h4>
  <p>
    Upon arrival, if the cart is at the property, first check it for any damage. Take pictures of all pre-existing damage found on the cart. Common areas to inspect include the top of the roof, curbed wheels, scratches in the paint, and cracked rear steps. Report all damage, even if it seems minor, via text message or email with photos attached. We examine the carts before delivery and prior to pickup. Please note that 99% of renters claim the cart wasn’t in their possession when it was damaged. Unfortunately, we cannot rely on the honor system anymore. If we find damage after your rental during our inspection, we will notify you with pictures and the amount required to fix it. Claiming that the cart was not damaged while in your possession will not be accepted, as it is your responsibility to report any previous damage. Any scratches that remove paint, curbed wheels, or other damage must be reported. By signing this, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to these terms.

    South Walton Carts does not refund for missed rental time due to issues with the property’s outlet. If the rental unit’s breaker trips, please try another outlet or contact the property manager for repairs. After you have sent in the damage photos, you will find the keys to the cart located inside the front driver’s side wheel. This is also where you will leave the keys upon departure.

  <h4>
    CHARGING INSTRUCTIONS (GAS CARTS DO NOT APPLY)

  </h4>

  <p>Most of our calls after the renter has received the cart are related to charging and runtime issues. Here are some helpful tips:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Electric carts are intended for short trips, not for all-day main transportation. When fully charged, you can expect to get 20-30 miles before it runs out of power. Most battery meters do not provide accurate readings. Always charge the cart whenever possible.</li>
    <li>The cart needs to be plugged in whenever it is not in use—no exceptions. Ensure the 110 outlet has power. Cart chargers pull a lot of amperage, so it’s common for a house breaker to trip. If this happens, try another outlet on a different circuit, ideally one on the opposite side of the house or an interior outlet.</li>
    <li>Most of our charging cords will light up to indicate that the 110 outlet has power. Once plugged in, locate the charger indicator light, usually on the dashboard, which should blink.</li>
    <li>We do not come out past 5 PM to pick up carts that are out of charge. You have two options: park it somewhere safe until the next day or call a flatbed tow truck to have it towed home. Never push, pull, or have it towed without a flatbed, as this may cause internal motor damage resulting in a $1,500 replacement cost.</li>
    <li>Please do not adjust the speaker bass and treble settings. Gas models will have enough fuel for the rental period.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Leave the cart on charge.</li>
